# Todo List Web Application  

This repository contains the source code for a simple **Todo List Web Application**, developed as part of **ISYS3001 Assessment 2 (Configuration & Procurement Management)**.  

The project demonstrates:  
- Configuration management using **GitHub** (branches, commits, pull requests).  
- A working web application built with **Node.js + Express** and **JSON file storage**.  
- Procurement planning (documented in a separate RFP report).  

---

 Features  
- Add new tasks  
- View all tasks  
- Delete tasks  
- Persistent storage in `tasks.json`  

---

Technologies Used  
- **Node.js** – runtime environment  
- **Express.js** – backend web framework  
- **HTML + CSS + JavaScript** – frontend UI  
- **JSON file** – simple data storage  
- **GitHub** – version control and configuration management

##  Project Structure  
# MSD-A2

Branching Strategy

The following Git workflow was used:

main – production-ready code

dev – development branch for integration

feature/add-task – feature branch for adding tasks

feature/delete-task – feature branch for deleting tasks

Each feature branch was merged into dev via pull requests, then merged into main after testing.

Configuration Management

package.json – manages dependencies

config.js – contains application settings (port, storage file)

README.md – setup and usage documentation

GitHub history – shows commit messages, branching, and merges

Procurement Plan (RFP)

A separate document has been prepared to justify the selection of tools and services, including:

Node.js

Express.js

SQLite/JSON storage

GitHub for version control

Render/Heroku (optional for deployment)

Screenshots (to be added)
